## Installation

Install all required native libraries for your Operating System as described in the 
[graph-tool installation instructions](https://git.skewed.de/count0/graph-tool/wikis/installation-instructions#native-installation).

**Note for Linux Users:** It might be necessary to import a `gpg`-key as superuser to be able to add
the installation repository to the system. The key import could be done with the following command:
```
sudo apt-key adv --keyserver pgp.skewed.de --recv-key 612DEFB798507F25
```
