## Usage of `bmwArchitecture_to_json`

The tool is placed in the `/src`-directory of this project.
The help could be shown with `./bmwArchitecture_to_json.py -h` or `./bmwArchitecture_to_json.py --help`.

This script aided in the creation of the file `bmw-arch.json` what 
contains all relevant information about the given to-be-architecture from BMW.
Its format is depicted in `bmwSoftwareArchitecture_archproj-bmwteam-schema.json`.

The `bmwArchitecture_to_json` scripts main use was to create the json file entrys for multiple components at once.

The file with the list of component-names was created by hand.

It has to be called by 

```bash
./bmwArchitecture_to_json.py OUTPUT_FILE COMPONENT_LIST_FILE domain contextGroup hardwareGroup
```
where `OUTPUT_FILE` is the output file that will be OVERWRITTEN
contains the above mentioned list generated by the jsonparser and `COMPONENT_LIST_FILE` is a `\n`-separated file 
containing the component-names.

E.g.

```bash
./bmwArchitecture_to_json.py test001.json testlist.txt "testDomain" "testContextGroup" "testHardwareGroup"
```

where `testlist.txt` contains:

```
1wandfrei
funk2ionierender
t3st
```

the resulting output in the `test001.json` would be:
```
[
  {
    "1wandfrei": {
      "domain": "testDomain",
      "contextGroup": "testContextGroup",
      "hardwareGroup": "testHardwareGroup"
    }
  },
  {
    "funk2ionierender": {
      "domain": "testDomain",
      "contextGroup": "testContextGroup",
      "hardwareGroup": "testHardwareGroup"
    }
  },
  {
    "t3st": {
      "domain": "testDomain",
      "contextGroup": "testContextGroup",
      "hardwareGroup": "testHardwareGroup"
    }
  }
]
```
as expected.

Note:
The insertion of these blocks still has to be done by hand.
